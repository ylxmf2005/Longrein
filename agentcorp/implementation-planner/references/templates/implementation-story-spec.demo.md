# Implementation Story: Example Title

Status: ready_for_plan_review

## Implementation Story

As a user or system actor,
I want the approved change completed,
so that the required outcome is met.

## Source Context

- Requirements: requirements/validated-requirements.md
- TestPlan/Test Strategy: test/test-plan.md
- Design artifacts: design/impact-analysis.md
- Plan Review status: pending
- Source of truth: repository for current code behavior; approved task artifacts for approved intent.
- Concrete context files read: list every existing file, no unresolved globs.
- Allowed edit roots: exact paths.
- Read-only context: exact paths.
- Key facts needed right away for implementation:
  - Write only the facts the engineer needs immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An observable acceptance condition traceable to a requirement.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] T1: Task title (AC: 1, target: module/file)
  - [ ] T1.1 A specific subtask.

## Implementation Constraints

- Module boundaries, patterns, contracts, data flow, behavior that must be preserved, and forbidden zones.

## Verification Expectations

- TestPlan/diagnosis decision criteria: path and section.
- Checks owned by the engineer: focused tests or commands.
- External verification: checks owned downstream by the Test Leader/testers.

## Review Focus

- The specific areas the Plan Review Lead should focus on.
