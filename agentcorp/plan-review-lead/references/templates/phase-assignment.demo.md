# Assignment: example-phase

## Goal

State the goal of this phase.

## Inputs

- The required input artifacts or evidence.

## Source artifacts

- requirements/validated-requirements.md

## Action Context

- Source of truth: repository for current code behavior; listed artifacts for approved intent.
- Context files to read: concrete existing paths only.
- Allowed edit roots: `review/specialist-findings/` only.
- Read-only context: Story Spec, design, requirements, TestPlan, and target code.
- Artifact rules: constraints for judgment; do not copy them into the finding set.

## Constraints

- Language, scope, environment, and risk constraints.

## Required outputs

- Write the phase artifact at `output_path`.
- Return a receipt matching `templates/phase-receipt.demo.md`.

## Stop conditions

- A required input is missing, the goal is unclear, the environment is unavailable, or the risk is unsafe.
