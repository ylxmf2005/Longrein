# AgentCorp Session Router

AgentCorp is a phased software-delivery pipeline packaged as skills. If the user mentions AgentCorp, Delivery Orchestrator, AgentCorp delivery workflow, a phase name, an AgentCorp role, or an AgentCorp artifact path, load the matching AgentCorp skill before answering, planning, or editing.

When the user states a software-delivery ask in plain language with no AgentCorp mention — a defect report ("帮我修个 bug", "报错了", "上次改动引入回归"), a requirement or spec handed over as fact, a refactor/maintainability ask ("让这个模块更好维护"), or a pre-release verification ask ("上线前帮我验一下") — do not silently start ad-hoc work and do not auto-load the pipeline either: offer it in one line ("这类任务我可以走 AgentCorp 交付流程(诊断/需求闸门/评审),要吗?") and route through `delivery-orchestrator` on a yes. These asks are exactly what the gates exist for; leaving them to freestyle answers is the adoption gap, forcing the pipeline on unrelated chat is the over-trigger trap.

Do not treat phase names or artifact paths as ordinary words. They are routing signals.

## Discipline Core

These non-negotiable rules hold for every AgentCorp response, regardless of which skill is loaded:

- **Evidence ≠ a verbal claim.** Show the artifact, test run, reproduction, or raw output. A claim without an inspectable handle does not count as done.
- **Defect "done" = the original failing input re-run.** When claiming a fix works, re-run the exact original input/scenario that failed — not a proxy sample.
- **Un-renderable output must be persisted.** Diagrams, diffs, walkthroughs, and anything a terminal cannot render go to a file, not dumped inline.
- **Lock scope; no silent fallback.** If you cannot deliver what was asked in the required scope (missing access, environment, or tool), say so — do not quietly substitute a weaker answer.

## Default Route

Use `delivery-orchestrator` when the user mentions AgentCorp, Delivery Orchestrator, AgentCorp delivery workflow, phased artifacts, gates, handoffs, task orchestration, workflow mode, task root, assignment/receipt, manifest, or asks which AgentCorp role should handle something.

After loading `delivery-orchestrator`, read `references/workflow.md` before choosing phases, owners, gates, workflow mode, handoff shape, or artifact paths.

## Phase And Artifact Routing

## Reference Loading Rules

- For `solution-architect` work on `interface-contract`, read `references/interface-contract.md`.
- For `solution-architect` diagrams, read `references/mermaid.md` before writing Mermaid.
- For `delivery-orchestrator` handoffs, read `references/handoff-protocol.md` and the relevant template under `references/templates/`.
- For `delivery-orchestrator` requirement validation, read `references/validate-requirements.md`.
- For fresh-start handoff or context-reset requests, use `delivery-orchestrator` and read `references/fresh-start-handoff.md`.
- For the `compound` phase or cross-task lessons (复盘/总结经验/沉淀), use `delivery-orchestrator` and read `references/compound.md`.
- For `probe` reports, read `references/templates/probe-report.demo.md` before writing.
- For `walkthrough` artifacts, read `references/artifact-format.md` before writing.
- For `explain` persisted artifacts, read `references/artifact-format.md` before writing.

## Operating Rules

- Human-facing AgentCorp artifacts follow the sponsor's working language (the task's `output_language`, recorded at intake; zh-CN when unstated); target code and infrastructure keep their original language.
- Keep task artifacts under `teamspace/`; if `teamspace/` appears in git status, add it to `.git/info/exclude`.
- Do not stage, commit, or push `teamspace/` artifacts, docs, tests, or markdown files unless the user explicitly changes that rule.
- For AgentCorp delivery work, stay backend-focused. Do not modify frontend code — unless the sponsor explicitly grants a frontend waiver for the task at a recorded gate — and do not treat frontend-owned issues as backend fixes. A frontend ask with no waiver gets an explicit one-line boundary reply naming what is out of scope and who can decide, never a silent generic attempt.
- Merging or pushing product code has no pipeline owner: it stays with the sponsor. When asked to merge/push, say so, and proceed only on the sponsor's explicit order with the Fix-Loop Protocol's pre-publish SCM gate.
- Preserve author/reviewer separation: a role must not approve its own artifact.
- Review findings must pass through `review-research` before `fix`; do not fix raw code-review findings directly.
