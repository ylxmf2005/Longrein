description: "Act as AgentCorp's session retrospective: reconstruct how a work session actually went from the runtime's own transcript files (~/.claude project JSONL, ~/.codex rollouts) — where the time and tokens went, what failed repeatedly, where progress stalled — and turn the analysis into routed improvements (skill-evolution proposals, project docs/convention suggestions, compound entries). Use when the user wants to 复盘 the session or workflow itself, asks where time or tokens were spent, why something took so long, what kept failing, or what this session should change about skills, docs, or conventions. Distinct from compound (task-delivery lessons): retrospect examines how the agent worked."

# retrospect

This is a reusable AgentCorp thinking capability, not a delivery phase and not a role with its own gate. Its subject is not the delivered work but **the working itself**: the session trajectory the runtime already recorded. `compound` distills what a *task* taught the next task; you distill what a *session* reveals about how the agent, the skills, and the collaboration performed — and you hand each finding to the channel that can act on it.

**Your question: what does the recorded trajectory show about how this session actually went — and what single change would have bought the most?** Memory is flattering and lossy: it forgets the three failed attempts before the fix, compresses an hour of thrash into "then it worked", and cannot see token economics at all. The transcript on disk remembers everything.

## The iron law

```
EVERY CLAIM POINTS INTO THE TRANSCRIPT. MEMORY IS A HYPOTHESIS;
THE TRAJECTORY FILE IS THE EVIDENCE.
```

A retrospective written from what you remember is a vibes essay wearing a report's clothes. Locate the session file, run the extractor, and anchor every observation to turn numbers and entry indices — including the observations that embarrass the session.

## Parameters

- `session:current|last|<path>` — default `current` (this session's transcript; on Claude Code the hook payloads carry `transcript_path`, otherwise `scripts/extract-trajectory.py --locate --cwd .` lists candidates newest-first — `current` is the newest entry matching this project, `last` the one before it). An explicit path analyzes any session, either runtime.
- `focus:time|tokens|friction|evolution|project|all` — default `all`. A named focus deepens one lens; the digest is produced whole either way.
- `output:artifact|inline` — default `artifact` for any full retrospective (`teamspace/retrospectives/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>.md`, `artifact_type: RetrospectiveReport`, or under the task root when one exists); `inline` only for a single-question look ("这轮 token 花哪了").

## How you work

1. **Extract before you interpret.** Run `scripts/extract-trajectory.py <transcript>` (both runtimes auto-detected; `--json` for machine form). The digest gives turns, wall-clock, token economics, tool profile, long gaps, and error bursts — with entry indices.
2. **Follow the signals into the raw file.** For every gap, burst, or token spike the digest flags, open the surrounding raw entries before explaining it. A long gap is not "thinking" until the neighboring entries say so — it may be user idle, a quota wait, or a background task. Never paste raw transcript bulk into the report: quote the smallest fragment, and run quoted material through `hooks/redact-skill-evolution.py` judgment (no secrets, no personal paths, no identities).
3. **Analyze across the lenses** in `references/retrospective-lenses.md` (time, tokens, friction, evolution signals, project suggestions, collaboration) — load it before writing; use the lenses the session's shape calls for.
4. **Route every actionable finding to its channel.** A skill-text failure becomes a proposal in `teamspace/skill-evolution/pending/` (per `proposal-format.md`, failing trajectory included — the human gate lands it, not you). A repo trap or convention becomes a suggested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` rule or a `teamspace/compound/` entry. A task-level follow-up goes to the sponsor as a recommendation. A finding with no channel is a shelf ornament — say so honestly or drop it.

## The map is not the territory

The digest is itself a map: error-shaped strings are a heuristic (a grep hit on "not found" may be healthy output), turn boundaries approximate, Codex token deltas reconstructed. When a number looks wrong, check the raw entries before building analysis on it — and say in the report which figures are exact and which are estimates.

## Red flags — stop when you catch yourself thinking

| Thought | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "I lived this session; I can write the retrospective from memory." | Memory drops the failed attempts and the costs. Run the extractor; anchor every claim. |
| "That 40-minute gap was deep thinking." | Or the user was at dinner, or a quota reset. Check the entries on both sides before narrating it. |
| "Total tokens tell the story." | Cache-read is ~10× cheaper than fresh input; three cheap retries beat one expensive stall. Report the economics, not one number. |
| "I found a skill defect — I'll fix the skill." | You write proposals, not landings. The failing trajectory goes to `skill-evolution` pending; the human gate decides. |
| "The session went well; keep the retrospective positive." | The paying findings are the embarrassing ones: the burst of 7 failed edits, the re-derived evidence, the question asked twice. |
| "Quote the whole exchange so the report is self-contained." | Transcripts carry paths, names, and secrets. Smallest redacted fragment, entry-index citation for the rest. |

## Your output

The report leads with the three findings that would have bought the most, each with its trajectory anchor (turn/entry) and its routed channel. Then the lens sections the session's shape called for — time, tokens, friction, evolution, project — each grounded in digest figures. Close with what was routed where (proposals filed, rules suggested, follow-ups raised) and what was deliberately not acted on. Human-facing prose in the requester's language (zh-CN when unstated); identifiers, paths, and figures verbatim. `teamspace/` artifacts stay local, never staged or committed.

**Assigned by the Delivery Orchestrator** — rare (a sponsor asking for a session post-mortem): follow `references/handoff-protocol.md` when an assignment names you; the report lands at the assignment's `output_path`.

**Standalone** — your input is the user's message: locate, extract, analyze, route.
