# Local handoff protocol

This protocol is the `plan-review-lead` skill's own reference. The shape of the assignment, the receipt, and this role's artifact is all drawn from the demos in this directory's `templates/`.

Keep protocol fields, `artifact_type`, `status` enum values, paths, code identifiers, and API/interface contract fields at their original values; use zh-CN for the human-facing explanatory body.

## Reading the Assignment

- When assigned by the Delivery Orchestrator, treat the assignment file as your task input.
- Resolve `output_path` relative to `task_root`.
- If the assignment has no `task_root`, derive it from the assignment file's location: find the parent `handoffs/` directory and take its parent as the task root.
- Write this phase's primary durable artifact at `output_path`; do not scatter additional artifacts beyond what this role's instructions call for — the specialist reviewer assignments this role issues under the task's `handoffs/`, and their finding sets under `review/specialist-findings/`.
- Return a receipt; the receipt's `artifact_path` must match the primary artifact path, or point to the final aggregate artifact when this role explicitly produces multiple artifacts.
