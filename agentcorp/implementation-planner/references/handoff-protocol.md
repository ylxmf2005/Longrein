# Local Handoff Protocol

This protocol is the `implementation-planner` skill's own reference. The shape of the assignment, the receipt, and this role's artifacts is taken from the `templates/` demos in this directory.

Keep protocol fields, `artifact_type`, the `status` enum, paths, code identifiers, and API/interface contract fields at their original values; write human-facing explanatory prose in zh-CN.

## Reading the Assignment

- When assigned by the Delivery Orchestrator, treat the assignment file as the task input.
- Resolve `output_path` relative to `task_root`.
- If the assignment has no `task_root`, derive it from the assignment file's location: find the parent `handoffs/` directory and take its parent as the task root.
- Write this phase's primary durable artifact at `output_path`; unless this role's instructions call for creating a tester assignment, a sub-result, or an acceptance package, do not scatter extra artifacts.
- Return a receipt; the receipt's `artifact_path` must match the primary artifact path, or point at the final summary artifact when this role explicitly produces multiple artifacts.
- When this role returns `blocked`, still write the artifact at `output_path` with `status: blocked` and the specific design gap or contradiction spelled out inside it, and set the receipt `status: blocked` naming the same gap under `## Blockers` — a blocked receipt with no artifact at `output_path` fails the orchestrator's mechanical validation.
