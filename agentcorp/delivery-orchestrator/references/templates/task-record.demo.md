# Task: Example Task

## Requester Request

- Original request or issue link.

## Success Criteria

- Observable completion conditions.

## Out of Scope

- Explicit non-goals.

## Baseline

- Base branch: origin/main (what this delivery merges into — sponsor intent confirmed at intake, never inferred from the current checkout)
- Working branch: feat/example-task
- Merge-base commit: <sha recorded when the baseline was verified>
- Stacked on: None. (or: <task_id> / <branch> — this task lands only after its parent merges)

## Selected Paradigm

- enhancement/delta-design

## Workflow Mode

- partial-delegation (choose one of: direct | partial-delegation | full-delegation)

## Interaction Pace

- continuous (choose one of: continuous | guided)

## Effort

- high (choose one of: low | medium | high | max)

## Phase Sequence

- validate-requirements -> test-plan -> test-plan-review -> impact-analysis -> implementation-plan -> plan-review -> implement -> code-review -> review-research -> fix -> verify -> acceptance-review -> deliver

## Gate History

- Requirements gate: approved | skipped | revised | blocked
- Standing sponsor preference: none | continue without routine pauses | <specific instruction>

## Active Constraint

- Blocked transition: None.
- Reason: None.
- Continueable work: All work permitted by current gates.
- Sponsor decision needed: None.

## Artifact Coherence

- State: coherent | needs_revision
- Triggering revision: None.
- Affected artifacts: None.
- Next owner: None.

## Execution Progress

| Work unit | Status | Owner | Evidence or blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example | pending | example-agent | None. |

## Decision Log

- Key orchestration decisions and their rationale.
