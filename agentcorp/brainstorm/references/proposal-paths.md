# Proposal Paths

Use this reference only for Mode 2: Multi-Path Proposal.

The proposal lenses below are not new AgentCorp roles. They are requirement-shaping viewpoints derived from existing AgentCorp responsibilities, phase gates, and artifact expectations. Do not present them as agents to dispatch. Use them to create different sponsor-selectable requirement paths.

## AgentCorp Proposal Lenses

Pick 2-4 lenses that fit the ambiguity.

- **Minimal-change lens** — shapes the smallest safe requirement set that can satisfy the sponsor intent while preserving existing behavior. Grounded in AgentCorp's scope control and change-hygiene discipline.
- **Validated-journey lens** — optimizes for the clearest target user/system actor, observable journey, success criteria, and non-goals. Grounded in `validate-requirements`.
- **Documentation/onboarding lens** — asks whether the sponsor's goal can be achieved through docs, examples, templates, discoverability, or handoff clarity before product/code changes. Use only when that is a real candidate, not as filler.
- **Design-boundary lens** — proposes changing boundaries, contracts, data/state flow, or architecture only when local behavior changes will not hold. Grounded in Solution Architect responsibilities.
- **Verification-risk lens** — favors the path with the clearest proof strategy and lowest hidden regression risk. Grounded in Test Planner, Test Leader, and acceptance evidence requirements.
- **Research-first lens** — defers commitment when an external fact, prior art, customer behavior, or codebase unknown decides the requirement. Grounded in Parallel Researcher and Review Researcher evidence discipline.
- **Delivery-scope lens** — shapes the path around what AgentCorp can deliver cleanly in this task: phase count, artifact burden, review gates, and residual risk. Grounded in Delivery Orchestrator ownership.

Do not use a lens if it is not meaningfully different for this task. Two paths that differ only in wording are one path.

Push at least one path past the sponsor's stated taste — hidden preferences only surface at the boundary, and a set of paths that all sit safely inside the request teaches nothing about where the real line is. Label it plainly as the stretch option so the sponsor knows it is deliberate.

When the undecided shape is visual or interactive, render each path as a disposable single-file prototype (self-contained HTML with realistic fake data — lorem ipsum hides layout problems) under `brainstorm/prototypes/` in the task root, excluded from git like all teamspace artifacts, so the sponsor reacts to the real thing instead of prose about it. Prototypes are reaction material, never product code.

## Required Shape For Each Path

Each proposed path must include:

- **Name** — short, specific, not a role title unless it names the lens.
- **Lens used** — one of the AgentCorp proposal lenses above.
- **What changes** — observable user/system behavior, not implementation mechanics.
- **Target actor and journey** — who experiences the change and how success is reached.
- **Must-haves** — requirements that would appear in validated requirements if this path is chosen.
- **MVP boundary / non-goals** — what this path deliberately excludes.
- **Acceptance signals** — what evidence would prove this path worked.
- **Main risk or tradeoff** — the cost, lost benefit, ambiguity, or verification risk.
- **Why choose it** — when this path is the right sponsor decision.

## Recommendation Rule

After presenting paths, recommend one. A hybrid is allowed only when:

- the hybrid uses pieces already visible in the proposed paths
- the sponsor can understand what was combined and what was dropped
- the hybrid still has a clear MVP boundary and acceptance signal

Never write validated requirements — from one path or several — until the sponsor selects a path or explicitly authorizes a hybrid. Your recommended path is not a selection; only the sponsor's is.
