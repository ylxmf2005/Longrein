# Artifacts: the Full Runtime Layout

[← back to README](../README.md) · [简体中文](artifacts_CN.md)

Every phase leaves a structured artifact with frontmatter (`artifact_type` /
`author_agent` / `phase` / `status` / `source_artifacts`), making the work
auditable and traceable. Not every task uses every file below: the tree shows
the full runtime layout, and AgentCorp creates only the phases, reviews, tests,
research packages, and handoffs that the task actually needs.

Conditional dual design remains inside the single `architecture` phase. `ArchitectureProposal` files are provenance only (`normative: false`); `design/architecture.md` is the sole implementation authority. A `DualDesignRun` directory is created only after activation, and a recorded pointer whose directory is missing fails closed.
