# Local handoff protocol

This protocol is the `api-contract-tester` skill's own reference. The shapes of the assignment, receipt, and this role's artifact are all taken from the `templates/` demos in this directory.

Keep protocol fields, `artifact_type`, the `status` enum, paths, code identifiers, and API/interface contract fields at their original values; use zh-CN for human-readable explanatory prose.

## Reading the assignment

- When dispatched by the Delivery Orchestrator, treat the assignment file as the task input.
- Resolve `output_path` relative to `task_root`.
- If the assignment has no `task_root`, derive it from the assignment file's location: when the file sits under a `handoffs/` directory, take that directory's parent as the task root; tester assignments under `verification/assignments/` have no `handoffs/` ancestor — take the directory containing `verification/` as the task root instead.
- Write this phase's primary persistent artifact at `output_path`; do not scatter extra artifacts unless this role's instructions call for creating a tester assignment, a sub-result, or an acceptance package.
- Return a receipt; the receipt's `artifact_path` must match the primary artifact path, or point to the final summary artifact when this role explicitly produces multiple artifacts.
