# Assignment

## Goal

Review whether this MR/PR diff is clean, traceable, and belongs in this change; cover both diff noise and scope residue.

## Input

- Diff:
- Task/Story Spec/requirements:
- API contract / diagnosis / review finding:
- Local formatter/linter results:

## Constraints

- Review change hygiene only; no correctness/security/performance/reliability review.
- Every finding must give an actionable recommendation: revert, split, keep-with-explanation, or originator confirmation.
